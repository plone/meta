    This makes it easier to insert in a Jinja template.
    Note: Initially this changed the dictionary inline, but then any changes
    are also written back to .meta.toml, if that is where the dictionary comes from.
    So return a new dictionary.

    * Fixes multi line strings.

        classifiers = '''
            Environment :: Web Environment

      toml reads it as:

        '    Environment :: Web Environment\n    Framework :: Plone\n'

      We want to have the initial newline back.
